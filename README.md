# Blog
Run on localhost/posts

Shortcomings:

The main shortcoming I had was allowing for existing posts to be editted. For some reason, I could not get the already exisintg information to stay within the form fields.

In addition to this, I was not able to style the blog due to my limited experience with CSS as well as time restrictions.
